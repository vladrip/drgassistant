##Finally updated to Season3!
<br>
**New changes:**
- Now build has description/guide! Redesigned build screen, all you need to do is to swipe to change everything: name, description, weapons, equipments, grenade.
- Switched game wiki from fandom to wiki.gg, because it is official and loads faster. But if you want to use fandom, there is possibility to switch between them both.
- Better sorting for build list, now they sort by game classes, which is more logical and comfortable.
- Fixed exporting and importing builds for newer androids. Also fixed "select all" button.
